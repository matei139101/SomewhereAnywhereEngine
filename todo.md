# Next steps
- Uniform buffers and MVP Matrices
- Texturing
- Depthbuffers
- Modelling
- Input Handling / Camera

# To-Do
- Add better logging and improve readability in the vulkan_wrapper.
- Remove the unsafe flags (Most vulkan API call functions are unsafe and need to be handled in a very specific way to make them safe. For simplicity sake all Vulkan calls are unsafe for now)
